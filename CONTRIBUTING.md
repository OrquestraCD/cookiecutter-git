# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!

Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

## Types of Contributions

If you are reporting a bug, please include:
* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Bug Fixes, New Features and Documentation
